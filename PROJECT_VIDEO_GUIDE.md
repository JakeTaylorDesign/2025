  title: "Your Project Title",
  // ... other project properties
  videos: {
    demo: {
      src: "https://www.youtube.com/embed/YOUR_VIDEO_ID",
      title: "Project Demo",
      caption: "Live demonstration of the final product",
      videoType: "youtube"
    },
    process: {
      src: "https://www.youtube.com/embed/YOUR_PROCESS_VIDEO_ID",
      title: "Design Process Walkthrough",
      caption: "Behind-the-scenes look at our design methodology",
      videoType: "youtube"
    },
    testimonial: {
      src: "https://www.youtube.com/embed/YOUR_TESTIMONIAL_VIDEO_ID",
      title: "Client Testimonial",
      caption: "Hear directly from our client about the project impact",
      videoType: "youtube"
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Supported Video Platforms

}
```

demo: {
  src: "https://player.vimeo.com/video/VIDEO_ID?h=HASH",
  title: "Project Demo",

## 📊 Video Analytics and Tracking

### YouTube Analytics
- Track views and watch time
- Monitor engagement metrics
- Analyze geographic data
- Identify drop-off points

### Custom Tracking
You can add custom analytics to track video engagement:

```javascript
// Example: Track project video plays
const trackProjectVideo = (projectSlug, videoType) => {
  analytics.track('project_video_played', {
    project_slug: projectSlug,
    video_type: videoType,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  });
};
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Video Not Loading
- Check that video is set to "Unlisted" (not "Private")
- Verify the embed URL is correct

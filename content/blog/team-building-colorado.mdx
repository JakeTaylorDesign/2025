## Q&A: Insights from the Field

### Give us some background on your experience and what you do in your current role at your company.

I'm a seasoned UX and product design professional with over 18 years of expertise in the field. Over the years, I have sharpened my skills through valuable experiences with Fortune 500 companies, top-tier agencies and dynamic startups. Currently, I am a product design director at JumpCloud, leading a talented team of product designers dedicated to shaping our cutting-edge global IT security platform.

### In your opinion, what impact will AI have on the future of design as a profession?

As UX and product designers, we must understand that we are entirely in control and responsible for all of these relationships as the user of these AI tools and services. Recognizing that we are the driving force behind this seemingly infinite source of imagination and productivity unlocks the true potential of AI and how it can enhance our workflows and creative outputs.

Alternatively, as designers become more ingrained in the AI and ML spaces, we are responsible for raising the red flag when AI is being misused. This can happen when it excludes groups of people or data or when poor design renders products unusable for their base.

AI lacks essential human qualities like empathy, creativity, and critical thinking. It is also lacking ethical guardrails or any sense of inclusivity for underrepresented groups. 

AI impacts every industry that embraces it, and design is no different. Again, we are in the driver's seat. AI is only as bright as the code or data it utilizes. It is only as creative, ethical, or inclusive as the user can prompt or guide it to be.

### What do you think design professionals should do now to prepare for the integration of AI into workflows?

As a designer, it's critical to understand the capabilities of any tool we intend to use in our projects, creative processes or workflows. Once we know their power and usefulness, we can integrate these new technologies and evaluate how to use them to fit our needs. 

When I begin learning about a new topic, I search for the professionals at the cutting edge and follow them on the social platforms they frequent the most. I'm also a big fan of newsletters that I can quickly scan to catch up on the latest news and trends. 

As someone who has worked in design for a while, I have never been the type to jump on trendy bandwagons just for the sake of it. But in this case, AI is only getting started and will not fade into the abyss anytime soon. As designers, now is the time to learn and grow alongside this technology.

By being part of AI's evolution, we can influence its growth and help to ensure these technologies mature with a focus on usability, ethics and inclusivity. Whether you view AI as a partner or a tool within your field, I would suggest that you explore how it can benefit you personally, professionally, or competitively.
